# 🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts individual medical insurance costs using Machine Learning techniques based on demographic and health-related factors.

The goal is to analyze how features such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region affect insurance charges and build an accurate regression model.
