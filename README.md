# 🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts individual medical insurance costs using Machine Learning techniques based on demographic and health-related features.

The objective is to analyze how factors like age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region affect medical insurance charges and build a predictive regression model.
